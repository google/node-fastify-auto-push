# Sample code using the `fastify-auto-push` plugin

**This is not an official Google product.**

This application is a simple static file server built on top of `fastify` and
`fastify-auto-push`.

## Notes

The certificate files used in this sample app (`certs/key.pem` and
`certs/cert.pem`) are self-signed certificates only for `localhost`
development, generated by
[`tls-keygen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tls-keygen). Chrome ignores
pushed resources when using untrusted certificates. You should register the
certificate with your OS to make Chrome trust the certificate. Or just
generate a new certificate with `tls-keygen` and replace the files with the
newly generated ones.

## Command-line flags

* `--port <number>` or `-p <number>`

  Specifies the port number to be used. Defaults to 3000.

* `--http2` or `--h2`

  Use HTTP/2 when specified, HTTP/1 otherwise.

* `--auto-push` or `--ap`

  Enable auto-push. Works only with `--http2`.
